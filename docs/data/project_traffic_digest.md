Trajectory: **on_track**
Dispatch pause: **inactive** (stuck PRs: 0)

## Achieved (grounded)
- Infrastructure and offline library are ahead of schedule; the primary AI learning track is running but not yet beating the market.
- FTSE 350 live screen and published dashboard are operational.
- Offline library: 21 graduated markets (focus: euro_depth).
- Ops automation in place: daily monitor, tier-1 backup, external cron scheduling.
- Engineering queue: 9 open, 2 merged supervised tasks.

## Gaps / watch
- Primary AI track still below ^FTSE after costs (-28.6% excess; history still thin).
